# Graph Types and Use Cases

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook demonstrating various graph types and their appropriate use cases. The notebook uses Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations.

## Graph Types Covered

The following graph types are explored in the notebook:

1. **Bar Chart:** Used to compare values across different categories.
2. **Line Chart:** Used to visualize trends and changes over time.
3. **Scatter Plot:** Used to show the relationship between two variables.
4. **Histogram:** Used to display the distribution of a single numerical variable.
5. **Box Plot:** Used to visualize the distribution of data and identify outliers.
6. **Pie Chart:** Used to show the proportion of each category in a whole.
7. **Heatmap:** Used to visualize data in a matrix format, showing the relationship between two variables using color
